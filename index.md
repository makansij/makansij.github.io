I work on NISQ-era algorithms (QAOA, LR-QAOA), noise-aware benchmarking, and
practical applications like LABS, routing, and portfolio-type problems.

## Selected Projects

- QAOA for LABS – scaling + noise behavior, with benchmarks vs classical heuristics.
- Noise-robust correlation-based rounding for QAOA.
- Device vs simulator benchmarks on IBM / IonQ hardware.

More soon.
