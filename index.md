## About

I work on NISQ-era algorithms (QAOA, LR-QAOA), noise-aware benchmarking, and
practical applications such as vehicle routing, robust fleet sizing, and
low-autocorrelation binary sequences. My background spans classical and quantum
algorithms, high-performance computing, and industrial R&D, and I’m an IBM
Certified Qiskit Developer and Qiskit Advocate.
