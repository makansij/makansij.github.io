## Classical/Quantum Algorithms for Network Optimization
*Aug 2020 – June 2024*  
PWICE Institute of USC · Los Angeles, CA

### Classical Optimization

- Successfully executed a multi-year research project from grant-writing
  through developing state-of-the-art classical and quantum solutions to
  practical constrained optimization problems, resulting in papers in both
  classical and quantum computing.
- Developed a novel classical algorithm for solving a robust optimization
  problem by mapping it to set cover.
- Validated performance using Solomon benchmark instances with up to 100
  nodes, implemented using Pyomo and NumPy.
- Achieved ≥ 50% speedup over Gurobi with tuned parameters on all tested
  instance types with > 25 nodes, while maintaining an empirical approximation
  ratio < 2.0 and a provable exponential asymptotic scaling advantage (see
  Publications).

### Quantum Optimization

- Designed a noise-robust QAOA for constrained optimization problems which
  exploits correlation between samples and provably converges to a feasible
  solution without post-processing.
- Showed the proposed algorithm obtains an 80% lower optimality gap, in
  similar time as state-of-the-art methods.
- Obtained computational results for graph problems of 50 nodes using Qiskit
  and C++ on a high-performance computing cluster to produce software
  deliverables for PWICE stakeholders (see Publications).

## Optimization of Energy Systems
*Dec 2017 – Aug 2020*  
Veritone Inc.

- Designed and implemented optimization algorithms for coordinating
  multi-agent energy systems, resulting in patented technology and commercial
  deployment as **Veritone CDI** on Microsoft AppSource.
- Built a symbolic interface in SymPy for formulating and solving optimal
  control problems via Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling constraint-aware
  optimization from real-world data.
- Integrated a C++-based numerical optimization engine with real-time
  simulation tools (NumPy, SimPy, SciPy) and scaled performance using
  containerized deployments on Azure HPC clusters.

## Optimization of Feature Selection
*Dec 2016 – Dec 2017*  
eSentire Inc.

- Collaborated with security domain experts to design threat detection as an
  optimization problem, successfully detecting three “beaconing” behaviors for
  the company’s first two customers.
- Formulated optimization problems to automatically design impactful features
  from lexicographic data, overseeing development from raw data extraction to
  results in a customer-facing UI.
- Owned several daily pipelines processing ~50 GB per day of customer proxy
  and DNS logs using Apache Spark and YARN across several pilot sites, two of
  which became the company’s second and third paying customers.
